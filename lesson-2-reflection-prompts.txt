What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You tell git that this repository is where most of your development code will reside. This enables git to track changes to it, and treat it as a series of snapshots in the development process.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
It acts like an intermediate stage between the working directory and the repository for changes to go in. You can logically group together certain changes and put them in the staging area for a commit, so that the logical flow of changes is maintained.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
